Description: This is a D3 implementation of a treap. This project's code is based on the opendatastructes.org algorithms and Robin Ladiges dheap implementation.

Instructions: 
Selecting the make random treap option will generate a random treap of the selected size.
By selecting a "value" and a "priority" you can insert a node with a selected value and priority.
The add to treap options allows you to add a value with a random priority.
The remove button removes the element with the selected value.
